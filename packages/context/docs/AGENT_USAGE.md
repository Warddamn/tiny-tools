## tiny-context (installed MCP)
- For large or PDF/Office files, choose the shortest useful path: `query_file` for a question, `read_section` for a known location, `file_map` only when you need an outline. Skip extra calls once the answer is sufficient.
- Questions about CSV/TSV/XLSX/Parquet data ("total by…", "how many rows…"): `query_table` with SQL (table is `t`). Never load raw rows into context.
- Logs: `summarize_log` first (add `focus: "errors"`); Grep/`extract` only afterwards, for the exact message it surfaced.
- Comparing two files, including office formats: `diff_files` (summary mode) instead of reading both.
- Verifying JSON/CSV/YAML/HTML/Markdown you just wrote: `validate_file`. Pulling emails/URLs/IDs/jq values out of files: `extract`.
- Small plain-text files (< 20 KB, e.g. notes, configs, short docs): just Read them and answer — do NOT also call file_map/query_file on a file you have already read. Grep is right for an exact string in one text file.
